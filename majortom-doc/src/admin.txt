== The Administatration Page ==

=== Log-in and Create Users ===

The server creates to users at the first start.

The first is the user admin with the password *sEcReT*. YOu should modify the password at once.

To modify the password visit:

-------------
SERVER/majortom-server/admin/
---------------

and click on *Show Users*.

After that you see the two users.

Edit *admin* and enter a new password. After pressing *submit* the new password is stored.

To create a new user, use *Add User* below the user table and enter the data.

The password is stored as hash, so you can't read the real password.
An APIKey is used in the tm-controller to permit access to the topic maps.

=== Configure Database Connection ===

The server can use the db-backend of MaJorToM, but only one databse at a time and only a POSTRES DB.

Configure the connection in the admin interface and after that create a new topic map with deselected *in memory* checkbox.

=== Create a Topic Map ===

To create a Topic Map, press *Create a Topic Map* in the admin interface.

The topic map needs a baselocator, which needs to be an URI and will be used to identify the topic map.

The in memory checkbox indicates whether the topic map is stored in memory or in the configured database (if non is configured an exception is thrown).

The filePath field can be used to load a topic map which is already in a directory on the server (the machine). A directory can be entered to load all 
topic map files in the directory into the new topic map.

To get a better loading performance the user can enter an initial capacity of all the maps used in the InMemoryStore. This applies only for inMemory topic maps.

Last but not least, the file field is used to upload an xtm or ctm file, which will be loaded after the creation of the topic map.

NOTE: Loading of files is done in background. Although the server indicates to be finished with creating the topic map, it may not be loaded already.

=== List of Topic Maps ===

In the list of topic maps the following operations are available:

* *delete* deletes a topic map from the topic map system including all data
* *clean* removes the content of the topic map. An empty topic map remains.
* *close* closes the topic map. This is only useful when using database topic maps. The topic map won't be available by the server but the data remains in the database.

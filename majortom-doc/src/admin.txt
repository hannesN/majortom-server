== The Administration Page ==

=== Log-in and create users ===

At it's first start, the server creates two default users.

The first one, the default administrator, is the user *admin* with the password *sEcReT*. You should modify the password as soon as possible.

To modify the password visit:

-------------
SERVER/majortom-server/admin/
---------------

and click on *Show Users*.

Edit *admin* and enter a new password. After pressing *submit* the new password is stored.

NOTE: The second default user is named Hans. He is there just so you have an user with API-Key to play around without creating a new one. He may disappear in future releases. 

To create a new user, use *Add User* below the user table and enter the user data.

The password is stored as a hash, so intruders can't read the real password.

NOTE: Users don't have an API-Key upon creation. The _admin_ user must create one in order to permit access to the topic maps for the user.

=== Configure Database Connection ===

The server is able to use the DB-backend of MaJorToM, but only one database at a time and only a POSTGRES database.

Configure the connection in the admin interface and after that create a new topic map with deselected *in memory* checkbox.

=== Create a Topic Map ===

To create a Topic Map, clock on *Create a Topic Map* in the admin interface.

The Topic Map needs a baselocator, which must be an URI and will be used to identify the Topic Map.

The _In Memory_ checkbox indicates whether the topic map is stored in-memory or in the configured database (if none is configured an exception is thrown).

The _Local file path_ field can be used to load a topic map which is already in a directory on the server. A directory can be entered to load all 
topic map files in the directory into the new topic map.

To get a better loading performance the user can enter an _Initial Capacity_ of all the maps used in the InMemoryStore. This applies only for in-memory topic maps.

Last but not least, the _Topic Map File_ field is used to upload an xtm or ctm file, which will be loaded after the creation of the topic map.

NOTE: Loading of files is done in background. Although the server indicates to be finished with creating the Topic Map, it may not be loaded already.

=== List of Topic Maps ===

In the list of Topic Maps the following operations are available:

* *delete* deletes a Topic Map from the Topic Map System including all data
* *clean* removes the content of the Topic Map. An empty Topic Map remains.
* *close* closes the Topic Map. This is only useful when using database Topic Maps. The Topic Map won't be available by the server but the data remains in the database.
